Libraries Used:
* Pandas: For data manipulation and creating DataFrames.
* BeautifulSoup: To parse HTML and extract necessary data.
* Selenium: For automating web browser actions, handling dynamic content, and scrolling through pages.
* re (Regular Expressions): To extract specific patterns from strings, such as ratings and distances.
  
Key Features:
1. Cuisines Scraping: The first script extracts data based on various cuisines, gathering restaurant names, ratings, delivery costs, distances, and links.
2. Dishes Scraping: The second script performs a similar extraction, focusing on specific dishes, allowing for a broader analysis of food options available in the area.

   
Both scripts ensure comprehensive data collection, enabling further analysis of restaurant performance, pricing, and customer satisfaction metrics.
